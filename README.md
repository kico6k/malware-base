# Malware Base by Kico
This is a simple malware base that I created whilst furthering my knowledge of malware. Instead of creating separate repositories of my studies and findings, I instead made one project with the following tricks:

 - Process Injection *(explorer.exe)*
 - Windows Defender Exclusions
 - Adding itself to startup

Whilst not being the cleanest code, it is a great base to study, to understand how malware works through common methods. 

*DISCLAIMER:* This code is for educational purposes and to further peoples understanding of malware. It is not intended to be used in any circumstances apart from learning and understanding.
